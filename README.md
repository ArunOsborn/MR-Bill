# MR-Bill
Recently converted into a python module, MR-Bill is a simple program for splitting bills from a receipt.

# To Use
Go to the folder named `mrbill`
In `bill.txt`
## Basics
- Write [price],[names of people who want this item (seperated with commas)]
- Run Bill.py and view the output
## Advanced
- Write an alias for a group of people [name of alias(ie. "shared")] = [names of people in this group to alias (seperated with commas)]
- Write a comment by writing "#" followed by the comment. The comment will terminate at the next comma
- The price can include most maths calculations (useful for factoring in discounts)
